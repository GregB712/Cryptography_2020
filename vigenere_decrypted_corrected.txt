I'M SORRY BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE AN EMPEROR 
THAT'S NOT MY BUSINESS
I DON'T WANT TO RULE OR CONQUE(CONQUER) ANYONE 
I SHOULD LIKE TO HELP EVERYONE IF POSSIBLE 
JEW, GENTILE, BLACK MAN, WHITE 
WE ALL WANT TO HELP ONE ANOTHER, HUMAN BEINGS ARE LIKE THAT 
WE WANT TO LIVE BY EACH OTHER'S HAPPINESS, NOT BY EACH OTHER'S MISERY 
WE DON'T WANT TO HATE AND DESPISE ONE ANOTHER 

IN(AND) THIS WORLD THERE IS ROOM FOR EVERYONE, AND THE GOOD EARTH IS RICH AND CAN PROVIDE FOR EVERYONE 
THE WAY OF LIFE CAN BE FREE AND BEAUTIFUL, BUT WE HAVE LOST THE WAY 
GREED HAS POISONED MEN'S SOULS, HAS BARRICADED THE WORLD WITH HATE, HAS GOOSE-STEPPED US INTO MISERY AND BLOODSHED 
WE HAVE DEVELOPED SPEED, BU(BUT) WE HAVE SHUT OUR SELVES IN 
MACHINERY THAT GIVES (US) ABUNDANCE HAS LEFT US IN WANT 

OUR KNOWLEDGE HAS MADE US CYNICAL 
OUR CLEVERNESS, HARD AND UNKIND 
WE THINK TOO MUCH, AND FEEL TOO LITTLE 
MORE THAN MACHINERY, WE NEED HUMANITY 
MORE THAN CLEVERNESS, WE NEED KINDNESS AND GENTLENESS 
WITHOUT THESE QUALITIES LIFE WILL BE VIOLENT, AND ALL WILL BE LOST 

THE AEROPLANE AND THE RADIO HAVE BROUGHT US CLOSER TOGETHER 
THE VERY NATURE OF THESE INVENTIONS CRIES OUT FOR THE GOODNESS IN MEN  - CRIES OUT FOR UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD - FOR THE UNITY OF US ALL 
EVEN NOW MY VOICE IS REACHING MILLIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD - MILLIONS OF DESPAIRING MEN, WOMEN, AND LITTLE CHILDREN - VICTIMS OF A SYSTEM THAT MAKES MEN TORTURE AND IMPRISON INNOCENT PEOPLE 
TO THOSE WHO CAN HEAR ME, I SAY - DO NOT DESPAIR 
THE MISERY THAT IS NOW UPON US IS BUT THE PASSING OF GREED - THE BITTERNESS OF MEN WHO FEAR THE WAY OF HUMAN PROGRESS 
THE HATE OF MEN WILL PASS, AND DICTATORS DIE, AND THE POWER THEY TOOK FROM THE PEOPLE WILL RETURN TO THE PEOPLE 
AND SO LONG AS MEN DIE, LIBERTY WILL NEVER PERISH 

SOLDIERS!
DON'T GIVE YOURSELVES TO BRUTES - MEN WHO DESPISE YOU - ENSLAVE YOU - WHO REGIMENT YOUR LIVES - TELL YOU WHAT TO DO - WHAT TO THINK AND WHAT TO FEEL! 
WHO DRILL YOU - DIET YOU - TREAT YOU LIKE CATTLE, USE YOU AS CANNON FODDER 
DON'T GIVE YOURSELVES TO THESE UNNATURAL MEN - MACHINE MEN WITH MACHINE MINDS AND MACHINE HEARTS! 

YOU ARE NOT MACHINES!
YOU ARE NOT CATTLE! 
YOU ARE MEN! 
YOU HAVE THE LOVE OF HUMANITY IN YOUR HEARTS! 
YOU DON'T HATE! 
ONLY THE UNLOVED HATE - THE UNLOVED AND THE UNNATURAL! 

SOLDIERS! 
DON'T FIGHT FOR SLAVERY! 
FIGHT FOR LIBERTY! 
IN THE SEVENTH CHAPTER OF ST. LUKE IT IS WRITTEN: "THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN MAN" - NOT ONE MAN NOR A GROUP OF MEN, BUT IN ALL MEN! 
IN YOU! 
YOU, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER - THE POWER TO CREATE MACHINES 
THE POWER TO CREATE HAPPINESS! 
YOU, THE PEOPLE, HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THIS LIFE FREE AND BEAUTIFUL, TO MAKE THIS LIFE A WONDERFUL ADVENTURE 
THEN - IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRACY - LET US USE THAT POWER - LET US ALL UNITE 
LET US FIGHT FOR A NEW WORLD - A DECENT WORLD THAT WILL GIVE MEN ACHANCE TO WORK - THAT WILL GIVE YOUTH A FUTURE AND OLD AGE A SECURITY 
BY THE PROMISE OF THESE THINGS, BRUTES HAVE RISEN TO POWER 
BUT THEY LIE! 
THEY DO NOT FULFIL THAT PROMISE 
THEY NEVER WILL! 
DICTATORS FREE THEMSELVES BUT THEY ENSLAVE THE PEOPLE! 

NOW LET US FIGHT TO FULFIL THAT PROMISE! 
LET US FIGHT TO FREE THE WORLD - TO DO AWAY WITH NATIONAL BARRIERS- TO DO AWAY WITH GREED, WITH HATE AND INTOLERANCE 
LET US FIGHT FOR A WORLD OF REASON, A WORLD WHERE SCIENCE AND PROGRESS WILL LEAD TO ALL MEN'S HAPPINESS 
SOLDIERS!
IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRACY, LET US ALL UNITE
